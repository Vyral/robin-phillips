Are you thinking about selling your home? Are you wondering when the right time to sell is? Sometimes, we can't choose when to sell our home. There might be a life-changing situation or a job that we're moving for. However, if you can choose when to enter the real estate market, here are four things you should consider:

**1\. Every market is different.** The news might say that homes are selling quickly and prices are high, but prices can differ even from county to county. Timing the market can change based on whether you're in the city or a more rural area. It's important to look at your micro-market when deciding to put your home up for sale.

**2\. Consider interest rates.** Most people need a mortgage when they purchase a home. We've been told that interest rates are going up, down, and then back up in 2022. Depending on the type of loan that you get, the timing of the purchase may be influenced, so it's important to speak to a lender and figure out what's right for you.

**3\. Seasonality.** Sellers traditionally thought that the best time to put their homes on the market was the spring selling season. The idea was to get it under contract before everybody moves in the summer. The reality is most homes will sell at any time of the year because of our low inventory. The most important things to consider when selling your home are condition, correct pricing, and whether itâ€™s ready to show.

**4\. Money isn't everything.** There are emotional and lifestyle factors that you have to consider. Are you waiting for the kids to graduate? Is that big job coming around the corner in just a few months? The market will still be there when the timing is right for you and your family.

Remember that the market looks different whether you're a buyer, a seller, or both. If you've been waiting since 2020 to make a decision, give me a call. I can help guide you through all of the variables. If you have any questions or want to get the process started, just call, text, or email me. I look forward to hearing from you.
