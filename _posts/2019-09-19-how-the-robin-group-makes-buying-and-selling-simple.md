As those of you who have been following my messages for a while will know, I’m passionate about making the buying and selling process simple. This is so important to my team and me, in fact, that we’ve created a full Excel spreadsheet on the financial aspects of these deals called “The Full Financial Picture.” **We’d be happy to send you a copy of this spreadsheet if you’re interested in reviewing it for yourself,** but I’d also like to share a few key points about today’s market with all of you now.

First and foremost, there’s the matter of today’s historic low interest rates, which have incentivized buyers to make quick home purchases while conditions last. As exciting as this is, these fast-moving deals can sometimes make it difficult for sellers to find a new home before their current property closes.Many sellers assume the only way to go about this complex transition is to get a bridge loan, which can be an expensive and gruelling process.&nbsp;

Thankfully, certain companies have made it their business to make bridge loans more accessible and affordable. One such company in our area is [Ribbon](https://www.ribbonhome.com/){: target="_blank"}. Essentially, **Ribbon helps sellers secure their dream homes by backing a cash offer on it—effectively eliminating any contingencies your offer might otherwise have.** The seller can then rent the property from Ribbon for up to 180 days while they complete the sale of their current property.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}<br><br>Not only does this put you in a great position to negotiate and eliminate the stress of trying to rush a home purchase in the middle of your home sale, but it also makes it easier to make repairs and renovations on your home so that you can sell it for top dollar. Beyond that, sellers who have moved out of their listing are able to host more showings, since it’s far easier to keep a vacant home in show-ready condition.&nbsp;

**All in all, my team and I couldn’t be more excited about the opportunity to partner with great companies like Ribbon.** After all, we have spent years perfecting systems and strategies to help buyers and sellers in all kinds of circumstances. We are truly committed to making buying and selling fun and simple.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me and my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
