Do you ever wonder why some homes sell faster than others? **The pricing strategy I’m sharing may make all the difference** when selling your home. Home sellers ask me all the time how they should price their home—what price will get more buyers through the door of their house to make an offer?

{% include pullquote.html %}

Nowadays home shopping portals designate brackets in which people look for homes. For example, if you price your home at $499,000 and you have a buyer that can afford $450,000 to $500,000, your home will fall into that bracket. What about all those buyers who can afford a $525,000 home? They would probably be thrilled to buy your $499,000 home if it was the perfect fit for them. Unfortunately, that home portal will bracket them from $500,000 to $525,000 or $550,000. So, those buyers would not see your home for sale.&nbsp;

I tell all of my sellers to stick with round numbers. It sounds a little counter-intuitive, right? We’re all used to that 99 cents supposedly making things more appealing than $1. Yet **we as agents must be smarter than the consumer when it comes to home prices** and knowing how to properly list a home. This pricing tip can make all the difference in bringing more buyers to your home and giving you higher offers.&nbsp;

If you have further questions about home pricing or anything concerning real estate, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I would love to help you.
