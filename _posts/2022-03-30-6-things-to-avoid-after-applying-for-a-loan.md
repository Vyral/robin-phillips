After you apply for a loan, nothing about your financial situation should change. Here are six things you need to avoid so that you can close on your new house:

**1\. Don’t deposit cash into your bank account.** The lender has to trace every dollar moving in and out of your account, and cash is very difficult to trace. If you feel you need to deposit cash, speak to your lender first.&nbsp;

**2\. Don’t make any large purchases.** Don’t buy a car, an expensive ring, new furniture, or anything else along those lines. I know you’re excited about your new home and want to buy furniture, but don’t do it. It’ll change your debt-to-income ratio, and the last thing we want is for you not to be able to close.&nbsp;

**3\. Don’t cosign on anyone else’s loan.** It obligates you to their loan and, again, it changes your debt-to-income ratio.

**4\. Don’t change bank accounts.** As stated above, the bank has to trace every single dollar, so make it easier for both them and you by having just one account for them to look through.&nbsp;

**5\. Don’t apply for new credit.** It’ll change your credit score. You don’t want to do anything to lower your credit score and increase your interest rate right before closing.&nbsp;

**6\. Don’t close any credit card accounts.** It may seem counterintuitive, but part of your credit score is how much credit you’re using out of how much is available. So if you close a credit card account, you’re reducing your available credit, which will negatively impact your credit score.

As always, if you have any questions about this topic, buying, or selling, reach out via phone or email. I would love to be your real estate resource.
