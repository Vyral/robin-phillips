*Here’s what the 2020 market tells us about what to expect in 2021.*

The real estate market in Charleston this year was phenomenal. **After a record-breaking 2019, 2020’s numbers were somehow even better.&nbsp;**

We’re up 15.6% in the number of homes sold and 8.4% in the average sale price in just one year\! Every single part of Charleston is in a seller’s market, with the exception of South of the Crosstown in Downtown Charleston. **Multiple-offer situations and low inventory are the norm, even during what is supposed to be our “slow” season.**

What’s going to happen in 2021? First, we’re hearing that **interest rates will remain very low, at least for the next year and possibly through 2023.** Now is the time to buy and lock in a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at a historically low interest rate.

As for inventory, I think supply will increase a bit this year, which is a good thing. On the flip side, builders are selling homes that aren’t even permitted yet. These home builders can only build so quickly, and there are parts of Mount Pleasant where they only issue so many permits per year. I**f you’re looking to buy a new construction home, know that these inventory levels will remain tight as prices continue to go up and demand stays strong.&nbsp;**

How much will prices go up though, and for how long? Nobody has a crystal ball, but we know that Charleston has stayed insulated from many national dips in the past and I think we’ll continue to see more people flocking out of big cities and into Charleston in 2021.

If you have any questions for me about what’s going on in your neighborhood and how you might benefit from buying or selling in the next year, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
