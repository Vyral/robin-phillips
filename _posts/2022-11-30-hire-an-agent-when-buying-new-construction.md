Are you thinking about buying a new-construction home? If so, don't do it alone. Today, I'm sharing three things that a real estate agent will do that can save you thousands of dollars:&nbsp;

**1\. Help you choose the right lender.** In Charleston, most new-construction builders have in-house lenders, and they're offering incredible incentives. However, is that incentive saving you money now and costing you more money later? Your real estate agent can help you decipher that so you don’t make the wrong choice.

**2\. Assist with the negotiation process.** Many buyers don't know that you can negotiate with the builder. Sometimes you can negotiate on the price, or for things like incentives or a free refrigerator. If you don't ask, you won't get it.

**3\. Be there during the blue tape walkthrough.** Also known as the home orientation meeting, this step happens about one week before closing. During that meeting, you’ll go over warranty information and discuss the major functions of the house. You also have the opportunity to walk through the house and put tape on any paint and drywall touch-ups that are needed, as well as go through the home inspection. We can help make sure you don’t miss anything.

If you're going to purchase a new-construction home, do it with your real estate agent and save thousands of dollars. If you have any questions, reach out to me by phone or email. I’d love to help you\!
