According to Derek Goulette, branch manager of Fairway Independent Mortgage, we are not in a real estate bubble. This is in direct contradiction to the persistent rumors we’ve been hearing in the media.&nbsp;

Real estate cycles trend every seven to nine years, and we’re currently about 11 years into our nine-year upswing, so it’s about time that the market started leveling out to become more neutral.&nbsp;

So how is the market different now compared to that of 2008, when there really was a bubble?

The fuel behind the last housing expansion was a unique set of products that don’t exist in today’s environment like subprime loans. We haven’t seen appreciation like that in this cycle at all; our rate of appreciation this time around has been fairly normal, which is healthy.

We both agree that our current market does, however, have more of an issue with affordability than we do a bubble. That means it’s a great time to sell—you probably won’t get a whole lot more from your home sale in the future than you will now.

Why, then, is it still a good time to buy, even though home prices are high?

Well, right now, interest rates are really low, which means that the next house you buy is not going to feel very different in terms of monthly payments compared to what you’re paying today.&nbsp;

But what happens if interest rates go up?

If interest rates rise by 1%, it’ll cause about a 12% price difference in terms of what you can afford. For example, if rates did rise by 1% over the next year, a house that costs $270,000 today would cost roughly $300,000 next year.
