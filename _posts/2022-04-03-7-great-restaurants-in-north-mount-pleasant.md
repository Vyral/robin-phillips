Today I’m sharing a few of my favorite restaurants in north Mount Pleasant; they have more than you think:

**1\. Fuji Sushi.** Located right off Highway 41, they have a great indoor space and outdoor patio area. I love eating on the patio because it has a pond with a fountain. I always get jojo rolls, which have tempura shrimp, spicy scallops, and avocado wrapped in soy paper. I have a glass of red wine with it, and it’s super yummy\!

**2\. Umi Japanese Restaurant.** They’re located in Park West in the public shopping center. The indoor area is small, but the food is wonderful. Every time I go there, they remember who I am and ask about David. I like to order the fantastic rolls, which look pretty amazing. Each roll is pink and green, filled with chunks of spicy tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and avocado.

**3\. Carmen y Juan.** I like off-the-beaten-path, non-chain restaurants, so I have to share this one with you. This is authentic Mexican food, and they have a cute patio where my dog, Kobe, is always welcome. Their margaritas are excellent\!

**4\. M&igrave; X&agrave;o.** This Vietnamese restaurant has authentic cuisine, and we love to get takeout from them. My favorite dish is the London broil with rice noodles, ginger beef broth, bean sprouts, and jalapenos.

Carolina Park is one of the newest neighborhoods in north Mount Pleasant, and they're building a retail restaurant area right across from Costco. There are a few great new restaurants there already:

**5\. Emoji Poké.** This is David’s favorite go-to lunch spot, and they have superb spicy tuna. So my go-to order is Robin’s poké bowl with spicy tuna, half rice, half lettuce, and avocado.&nbsp;

**6\. Front Porch Coffeehouse and Creamery.** They have such a cool, eclectic vibe. They offer coffee, frappes, gourmet popsicles, bubble tea, and more. They also have a lovely outdoor porch with umbrellas. I usually order the classic bubble tea, which is milk tea, boba, taro, and Thai iced tea.&nbsp;

**7\. Wasabi.** This is one of my favorite places to have lunch with clients or other agents because they have indoor and outdoor seating and a beautiful bar. Their tempura shrimp appetizer is one of my favorites, and it includes shrimp, shiitake mushrooms, asparagus, and carrots.&nbsp;

Let me know in the comments below what your favorite restaurant in north Mount Pleasant is\! If you ever have any real estate questions or needs, call or email me. Maybe we can meet up at a great place for lunch or a drink. I would love to help with whatever you need.
