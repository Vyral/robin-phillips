*Just because open houses don’t typically lead directly to a sale doesn’t mean they aren’t of great value. Here’s what I mean.*

I’m here at one of my most beautiful listings, 1440 Madison Court. Located in the heart of Mount Pleasant, this truly multi-generational home lends itself well to our message today on open houses.&nbsp;

According to the National Association of Realtors, less than 1% of all homes are sold at an open house, so why even bother?

Well, here are four reasons why you absolutely should:

**1\. Open houses bolster your online presence.** All of the major listing websites will push your listing to the top whenever there’s something new and fresh happening with it. Open houses are a great way to generate new activity without changing the price.&nbsp;

**2\. Open houses allow unrepresented buyers to see your home.** If they don’t have an agent, these events enable a buyer to potentially put an offer in. If the home sells to an unrepresented buyer, it means you will save money on commission.&nbsp;

**3\. Open houses create fear of loss.** Buyers who are on the fence about submitting an offer will be motivated to pull the trigger if they see you’re hosting an open house soon. Fear of loss is one of the most powerful negotiating chips out there. The beauty of an open house, of course, is that it’s not just one showing—it’s a window of time in which you get lots of showings, creating an incomparable buzz that will have buyers thinking, “Gee, someone really might swoop this house today.”

**4\. Open houses create a neighborhood buzz**. Who better to sell your house than your neighbors? They won’t buy it themselves of course, but if you take the time to invite them to your open house, they may reach out to other people in their network and convince them to seriously consider the property. After all, they already know and love the neighborhood, so the prospect of having their friends or family move in may excite them.&nbsp;

If you need more tips on how to have a great open house, reach out by phone or email anytime. I’d love to hear from you and answer any real estate-related questions you may have.
