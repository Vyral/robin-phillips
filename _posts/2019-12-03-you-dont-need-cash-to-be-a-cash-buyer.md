Being a cash buyer (or at least as good as one) doesn’t require you to actually put up the full sales price in your own cash when you make a home purchase. All you really need to do is understand the difference between a pre-approval and a pre-qualification. While having a pre-qualification letter doesn’t fully verify your ability to move forward with a deal, having a pre-approval letter makes you as good as a cash buyer in the eyes of any seller. Why? Well, buyers who have been pre-approved have the full support and confidence of their lender. This, in turn, gives the seller and their agent confidence in you and your offer.
