There's an amazing lending product out there called the “2-1 Buydown.” I’ll explain how it works: If you locked in an interest rate of 6.99%, you would pay 2% lower for an entire year. After paying 4.99% for 12 months, you would pay 1% lower or 5.99% for a year. In the third year, the payment would revert to a fixed 6.99% for the rest of the 30 year term.&nbsp;

There are two really cool things about this program. **At any time during those three years or even afterward, you can refinance.** Most economists are predicting that interest rates will rise but then decrease once inflation is under control. Additionally, this is a seller-paid cost, meaning the buyer cannot pay the lender for the 2-1 Buydown.

Get out there and talk to your real estate agent and your lender to see if this product is the right way to go. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to helping you get your dream home.
