As a home seller, here are the six tips you must follow if you want to increase your home’s value and decrease its time on the market:

**1\. Clean and touch up everything.** Clean it until it looks the way you’d want it to if you were moving in. Clean the baseboards, the ceiling fans, the areas under the couches, every nook and cranny in the kitchen, etc. Every little bit of paint that needs to be touched up should also be taken care of.&nbsp;

**2\. Declutter.** When I say less is more, I absolutely mean it. If you have shelving next to a fireplace, for example, stick to only setting out one or two items per shelf. Also, remove any furniture that makes the rooms they're in look small. When buyers walk into your home, it should feel as big as possible.&nbsp;

**3\. Neutralize.** The paint colors and fabric tones in your home should be neutral. Additionally, take down most of the personal photos you have hanging on the walls. A wedding picture here or there is fine, but you don’t want the family portrait hogging the wall space.&nbsp;

**4\. Take great photos.** When I say “great,” it means your iPhone camera isn’t going to cut it. People want to see light, bright images of homes, because most buyers start their home search online. Your home’s photos are the first impression buyers will get of it, which makes them one of the most important marketing tools you have.&nbsp;

**5\. Set the right price.** There are many pricing strategies you can follow, but none of them involve overpricing your home. There is information online detailing how to set the right price, and, of course, your real estate agent can help with this as well.&nbsp;

**6\. Spread the word.** Now that your home has amazing photos, they need to be on as many websites as possible. The more eyeballs you can attract to your listing, the higher the demand will be for it. The higher the demand, the higher the sale price. It’s extremely important to hit every single avenue available—Facebook pages, your surrounding neighborhood, open houses, etc.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about how to sell quickly and for top dollar or you don’t yet have an agent to help you do so, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.<br>&nbsp;
