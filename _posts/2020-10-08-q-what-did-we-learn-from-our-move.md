Here’s some advice if you are planning a move anytime soon.

David and I just finished selling our home and buying a new one during a global pandemic. We did it with a massive home sale contingency, pulled every trick in the book to make sure the sale went smooth, and we still ran into a few speed bumps along the way. Today I’m excited to share what we learned during the process in the hopes that it will help you if you find yourself in a similar situation.
