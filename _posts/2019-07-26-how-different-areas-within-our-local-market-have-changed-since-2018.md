We’ve passed the midway point of 2019, and, as such, now is the perfect time to check the pulse on our Mt. Pleasant area market.&nbsp;

First, despite what many predicted, interest rates have actually gone down. They are currently sitting at 3.875% for 30-year fixed conforming loans, which is fantastic news for anyone thinking of buying a home soon.&nbsp;

It’s also worth noting that 88 more homes sold this year than during this same time in 2018. However, our market is still slowing down compared to the ultra-hot conditions that became the norm during these last couple of years. It will be interesting to see how the rest of 2019 plays out.

For now, let’s break down recent activity by examining how different areas of our broader Mt. Pleasant area market are doing, starting with West Ashley.&nbsp;

The median sales price in West Ashley between January and May of 2018 was $275,000. Over that same period this year, the median sales price was $272,000. Also, 501 homes sold during that period last year, while just 460 sold this year. That constitutes a decrease of 10%. However, we’re still in a seller’s market.

In James Island, the median sales price between January and May of 2018 was $325,000. This year during that same time, the median sales price was $327,000. And just like in West Ashley, the number of homes sold this year was significantly lower than what sold last year, with 404 properties having sold last year and just 379 having sold this year.&nbsp;

Moving on, Johns Island saw some more exaggerated developments. Last year, the median sales price between January and May was $306,000. This year, it was $328,000. This massive increase in sales price is partially thanks to a large number of new construction properties being built and sold in that area. However, like the other areas we’ve mentioned, fewer homes sold this year compared to 2018. This year, just 318 properties sold, compared to last year’s 354.&nbsp;

In Mount Pleasant South, the median sales price was $455,000 in 2018 and $500,000 this year. That’s an incredible price increase for just one year. Still, the number of homes sold has dropped. 508 homes sold in the area last year, while just 449 sold this year.&nbsp;

Mount Pleasant North is a slightly different story. There, the median sales price remained largely flat year over year, but the sales volume increased to 524 homes sold.&nbsp;

In Isle of Palms, the median sales price went from $950,000 to $1,056,000 year over year. However, as was the case in many other areas, the number of homes sold dropped from 69 to 60. Also, the increased supply in Isle of Palms has pushed the area into a buyer’s market. So if you’re looking for a beach home, now may be a good time.&nbsp;

Not all areas are seeing these same conditions. The decrease in sales volume is an issue that largely applies to higher-end price points. More affordable areas like Summerville and Moncks Corner have seen prices and sales volume increase year over year.&nbsp;

The bottom line is this: If you live in any of the areas we’ve mentioned where prices have risen and volume has dropped, now is a great time to sell. And anywhere where prices and sales volume are both going down will be a great place to buy.&nbsp;
