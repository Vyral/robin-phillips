If you’re a homebuyer, you’re probably going to get involved in a multiple-offer situation. We have a very strong seller’s market, and there just aren’t enough houses to keep up with the demand for them. Here are five ways that you can win against other buyers if you find yourself competing for a home:

**1\. Offer the highest price you can afford.** Gone are the days of sending in an offer and receiving a counter. You need to go in there with everything you’ve got. You need a high price, and you could also consider an escalation clause. That’s where you offer a price and say that you’ll pay a certain amount over the next highest offer up to a ceiling. You won’t necessarily overpay because you put a cap on your offer, but it makes your offer stronger in the eyes of a seller.

You could also put down a lot of earnest money. In South Carolina, we don't want to go above $7,500 because it takes you from small claims court to big boy court, but anything up to $7,500 is great. That money is yours and goes towards your closing, so it’s worth it if you really love the home.

Also, consider offering an appraisal gap. If you offer $500,000 and the home appraises for $490,000, that means you need to bring cash to the table for the difference.&nbsp;

**2\. Get your finances in order.** It’s so important to get a local lender who can get you approved through underwriting, send that pre-approval with the offer, and go the extra mile to call the seller and vouch for you.

**3\. Find out what’s important to the seller.** Before you make your offer, your agent should be checking in with the seller’s agent to find out what’s important to them in an offer. Call that listing agent and ask if the seller needs time to rent the home back or if there’s anything else other than the price that’s important to them.

**4\. Make your offer as clean as possible.** This means a super short inspection period or no inspection period at all. Consider whether you need an appraisal. If you can waive it, all the better. Talk to your agent before doing this, but it can really make your offer stand out.

A clean offer also means not asking for small things like a home warranty or transfer fees. Put all of that cost onto the buyer.&nbsp;

**5\. Consider a cash offer.** Depending on where you are in the country, some lenders are providing bridge loans that let homebuyers purchase their new home before they sell. There are other programs like Homeward and Knock that offer a similar option.

If you have any questions about buying a home in this market or need specific advice regarding real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
