<center><em>Here&rsquo;s how buyers and sellers can take advantage of this market.</em></center>

We’re in a crazy real estate market right now. Today I’ll cover what’s already happened in 2021 and what you can expect in the future. I’m sure you’ve heard that we’re in a seller’s market, but why? Inventory is still historically low, and for various reasons, we don’t see that changing anytime soon. However, buyers can take advantage of this market too.

**Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch it in its entirety or use these timestamps to browse specific points at your leisure: **

0:21—Inventory is low in all price points, and it’s pushing prices up

2:39—Why we don’t expect much to change moving forward

3:54—Why people are hesitant to put their homes on the market

5:00—What will happen when the mortgage forbearance period ends?

7:11—Why it’s a wonderful time to buy and sell

8:05—Wrapping things up

As always, if you have questions about our market or want to capitalize on these conditions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help.
