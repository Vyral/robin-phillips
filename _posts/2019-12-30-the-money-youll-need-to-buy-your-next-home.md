Aside from your down payment, how much will it cost you to buy your next home? What other cash do you need? Basically, you need two additional pools of money.&nbsp;

**The first is your upfront money**&nbsp;or money you’ll need for the initial purchase. When you make an offer on a home in Charleston, it’s customary to put up earnest money. There’s no set amount for this, but if you buy in the $500,000 to $550,000 range, it will normally cost anywhere from $1,000 to $6,000. You’ll also need about $500 for an appraisal (which your lender will order), between $350 and $650 for your home inspection, and another $150 for your termite and moisture inspections. All in all, your upfront money will total around $3,600 or $3,700.

The second pool of money you’ll need is for **your closing costs**. If we’re using the same $500,000 to $550,000 price range as our example, your closing costs will add up to about $10,000. There are a lot of variables that go into that number, but the process will always include items such as:

* Legal fees&nbsp;
* Title insurance&nbsp;
* Lender fees&nbsp;
* The start of your escrow account&nbsp;
* A year’s worth of homeowners insurance&nbsp;
* Any kind of prorations like HOA fees and property taxes

If you have your down payment amount, upfront money, and closing costs accounted for, you’re fully prepared for the purchase of your new home\!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
