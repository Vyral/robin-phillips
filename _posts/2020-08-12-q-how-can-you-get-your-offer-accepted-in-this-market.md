<p style="text-align:center">Here’s how to get your offer acceptedin a market with multiple-offer situations abound.</p>

In our red-hot seller’s market, if you want to successfully purchase a home amid throngs of competing buyers, be sure to remember these five tips:

**&nbsp;1. Make your first offer strong.** With the amount of competition, your first offer may be your only chance.

**&nbsp;2. Add an escalation clause.** This means adding a clause to your offer that states your offer will escalate by a certain amount over the highest offer, up to a cap amount. Sometimes outbidding your competition by only $1,000 or $2,000 makes all the difference.

**&nbsp;3. Have your lender call the listing agent personally.** That way, they can assure them that you’re well qualified for the purchase of the seller’s home, making the seller much more confident about accepting your offer.

**&nbsp;4. Make a clean offer.** The best way to compete with a cash offer is to remove as many requests and contingencies as possible. Don’t request appliances, aesthetic repairs, or assistance with closing costs and the like.&nbsp;

**&nbsp;5. Send a letter.** Sending the seller a personal letter about you and your family and why you want to purchase their home so badly is a good way to tug on the seller’s heartstrings. Making a personal connection like this can make your offer more memorable. Be sure to include a family picture\!

Be sure to hold these tips in mind because the Charleston market is very tough right now. Normally, we have around 5,600 homes for sale; right now, inventory is currently at about 3,700 available homes. On top of that, buyer activity is through the roof\! We have an unprecedented number of homes selling each week—around 500\!
