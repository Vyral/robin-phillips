<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Here are three reasons why now is a good time to sell your home.</em></p>

People have been asking us whether it’s a good idea to sell their home in today’s market, so today we’ll break down our response into three different points that will inform your understanding of our market’s condition:

**1\. Supply and demand.** Demand is off the charts in our market. Last week, 542 homes went under contract—this same time last year, only 307 homes went under contract. This was another record week for our MLS. We cannot stress to you enough how many buyers are waiting in the market to purchase your home. As far as our supply, inventory is very low. We normally have around 5,500 listings available in the tri-county area, but right now, we only have 3,344. So what impact will that have on home prices? With demand high and supply low, that means homes prices are on the rise.

**2\. Interest rates.** Our rates are historically low, which means that buyers are definitely motivated to purchase homes. Some VA loans we’ve seen have rates as low as 2.6%, and some conventional loans at 3%. Even with home prices on the rise, that makes homes much more affordable, and buyers are taking advantage.

**3\. What we know now versus what we’ll know in the future.** We know that interest rates are at historic lows and that the lending market is very positive at the moment. What we don’t know is what is going to happen later this year with COVID-19; we may end up with a second wave. Earlier this year, the pandemic pushed our spring market back to the summer, and there’s also the matter of the upcoming election to consider.

All in all, now is a very good time to be a home seller. If you’ve been thinking about it or have any questions about the market, give us a call. We’d be happy to talk you through what we know and come up with the best way for you to move forward. Hope to hear from you soon\!
