<p style="text-align:center"><em>As we head into June, conditions are ripe for both homebuyers and sellers.</em></p>

A lot of people have been reaching out as of late to ask about home prices, home demand, financing, and much more related to buying or selling a home. Today I’m here to answer all of those questions for you in one place.

**First, let’s talk about the demand for homes.** It slowed down for a bit a few months back, but it has since gone through the roof. The number of homes under contract right now is the highest we’ve seen since 2005! If you’re looking to sell your home, this is the perfect opportunity.&nbsp;

If you’re looking to buy a home, you might be worried about prices, interest rates, and financing. As for prices, they’re not decreasing. **There are a few soft spots, but for the most part, prices are only going up.**

When we first went under lockdown, some of the banks went a little crazy and financing was a lot harder to get. However, things have eased up since, and everybody is open for business with incredible rates. We just qualified a client at 2.875%! **If you’re looking to buy, you'll save more by buying with these rates than waiting for prices to drop.**

How is all of this possible in the middle of a pandemic? **It all starts with the health and safety precautions we’re taking.** If you have an unoccupied home, it’s a great time to sell, but if you’re living in your home, that’s a whole different story. We vet buyers online first to limit the number of in-person visits, and we require masks, sanitizer, etc., for anyone who steps foot inside your house. We’re making sure buyers don’t touch any door knobs or surfaces either. We’re also asking sellers to sanitize their homes before and after showings.

If you’re a buyer, expect to be asked to take your shoes off, wear a mask and gloves, and use sanitizer. If you’re in a category where you’re more vulnerable to the virus but still need to sell, we can help you there too. **Through the use of virtual tours, we’ve sold homes to buyers who had never stepped foot in the home.&nbsp;**

Right now, as more and more restrictions are being lifted, the opportunity to buy or sell a home has never been better. As long as we’re all following the proper health and safety protocols, you can take advantage of the market in its current condition.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
