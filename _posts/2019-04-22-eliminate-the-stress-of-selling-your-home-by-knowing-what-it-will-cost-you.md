How can you eliminate the stress of selling your home?&nbsp;

Most sellers, when selling their home, are also in line to buy another one afterward. Figuring out what it’s going to cost to sell your home is only half the picture, then, because you have to use the money from that sale to purchase your next home.&nbsp; &nbsp;

**That’s why eliminating the stress of selling your home boils down to two very important steps.**The first is hiring an excellent real estate agent and lender. The second is looking at your whole financial picture—what it’s going to take to sell and buy.

In the video above, I’ll show you an example of what your whole financial picture will look like and all the costs that need to be calculated.&nbsp;**For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps so you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most:**&nbsp;

* 0:57—Home preparation costs
* 1:49—The closing costs and other expenses you’ll deduct from your final sale price once you do sell (i.e., the seller’s net before the mortgage payoff)&nbsp;
* 3:27—Moving costs
* 4:15—The cost of the down payment for your next home
* 4:38—Closing costs for your next home
* 5:50—The final tally of what you’ll need to complete the transaction

Your agent and your lender can provide you with these numbers when the time comes for you to sell, which is why it’s so important that you hire the right people for the job and that they work together.&nbsp;
