What’s coming up in the 2022 market? Today I’ll discuss a few key real estate predictions about the Charleston market to keep in mind as we move deeper into the new year.

Nationally, inventory levels are down by almost 27%. In South Carolina, they’re down by almost 40%. As of right now, we have fewer than 1,2000 homes for sale in our MLS—that’s crazy low. Home prices rose substantially between 2020 and 2021, having increased by 31% year over year. On average, that equates to $57,000 in home equity gained in just a year.

That begs the question: Has the market peaked? **Analysts have predicted about a 5% increase this year to next year.** That’s not as much of a change as last year, but it’s still good for homeowners, and it means that now is an excellent time to sell your home.

**It’s also a good time to buy.** Interest rates are set to increase this year to somewhere between 3.4% and 3.6%, so a mortgage will cost you more each month. That’s why, in general, I suggest you buy sooner rather than later. However, remember that every price point is different, just like how every market in Charleston is different.

If you have any questions or are looking to buy or sell a home in the area, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’m happy to help.
