<p style="text-align:center"><em>Despite the ongoing pandemic, buyer activity has been off the charts.</em></p>

For today’s message, you’ll have to excuse the fact that we have no desk; we’re in the middle of remodeling our home as we gear up to sell it (if you’re wondering whether now is a good time to sell, listen to the real estate agents who are actually selling their homes)\!&nbsp;

I’m sharing the most important things you need to know about our Charleston market now that we’ve reached the halfway point in 2020. For starters, 25% more homes are going under contract week over week than this same period last year, there are just 4,000 homes on the market, and VA loans hit 2.6% this past week!&nbsp;

**Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to skip to topics that interest you most:&nbsp;**

0:45 — Buying activity is incredibly strong&nbsp;

1:48 — We’re seeing low interest rates across the board; will they stay that way?

3:08 — Inventory levels are low&nbsp;

3:56 — Prices will remain strong&nbsp;

4:43 — Updated COVID-19 guidelines&nbsp;

5:30 — Wrapping things up&nbsp;

If you have questions about anything mentioned in this video or are thinking about buying or selling soon, please feel free to reach out to me via phone or email. I truly believe now is a great time to capitalize on low inventory and sky-high demand—I wouldn’t be selling my own home otherwise—so I’d love to help you craft a game plan to help you get your home on the market.
