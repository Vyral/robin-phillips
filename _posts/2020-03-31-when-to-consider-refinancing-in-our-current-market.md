<p style="text-align:center"><em>Whether refinancing makes sense for you or not depends on how long you plan on staying in your current home.</em></p>

Should you consider refinancing now that interest rates are so low?&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let’s say you call your lender and they tell you that by dropping the interest rate on your 15- or 30-year fixed-rate loan, you can save $300 per month on your mortgage payment. That’s awesome, right? Well, **that savings will cost you a refinancing fee, and that fee varies depending on the amount of your loan.&nbsp;**

If it costs, say, $5,000 to save $300 each month, it will take you about a year and a half to recoup that fee. This means if you’re planning on moving in a year and a half, it’s probably not a good idea to refinance because you won’t even get to enjoy the benefits of it.&nbsp;

**If you pl****an on staying in your home for 5+ years, though, refinancing makes sense.** We’re in an uncertain time right now, and cash flow is king. The more money you can save, the better. After things pick back up, you can start paying down your mortgage with the low interest rate you secured and the money you saved. Not to mention the amount of time you’ve also reduced on your mortgage. Think about all the necessities you can spend that extra $300 per month on right now instead of your current mortgage payment\!

More than anything, this is a timing issue, so talk to your lender and see whether it’s right for you. If you don’t have a lender, we work with several we’d be happy to introduce to you. For all you salespeople and small business owners, we also know a lender who offers an all-in-one loan package that affords you the leverage you need between the timing of your commissions and your monthly payment.&nbsp;
