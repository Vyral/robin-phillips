What are homeowners association (HOA) fees and regime fees? Here’s a quick overview.&nbsp;

**HOA fees exist so homeowners can pool funds into one bank account.**&nbsp;They do this for two reasons. The first is to maintain the neighborhood common areas (pools, tennis courts, parks, ponds, etc.). The second is to maintain property values. HOA residents want everyone’s homes to look nice, so HOAs will levy fines to anyone who is not taking care of their property.&nbsp;

Those are the benefits of HOA fees, but one of the drawbacks is CC&Rs (community covenants and restrictions). These basically tell you what you can and cannot do to the exterior of your home. In many cases, they also have parking restrictions, large-vehicle restrictions, and building restrictions. Before you buy a home in an HOA neighborhood, make sure you get a copy of the CC&Rs so you know what your restrictions are.&nbsp;

Many Charleston neighborhoods have swimming pools, tennis courts, clubhouses, etc., so if you see a high HOA fee or one that is high in comparison to another neighborhood, it may be because the HOA is paying to maintain these features.&nbsp;

If access to a pool is important to you, moving into an HOA neighborhood is a great way to obtain a pool membership. If it’s not important, look at a neighborhood’s HOA fees before buying a house in that area, because you may have to pay for a pool whether you want to or not.&nbsp;

**Regime fees only exist for condo and townhome units, and they’re separate from HOA fees.**&nbsp;Because condos and townhomes have common walls and roofs, regime fees are pooled into a common fund to maintain the building. You don’t have to pay to repair the roof or repaint the exterior. You also don’t have to worry about mowing the lawn or maintaining the landscaping. These regime fees act as maintenance costs you would pay anyway if you owned a standalone home.&nbsp;

The downside to regime fees is you’ll likely pay a little more than you want to for these maintenance tasks. When purchasing a condo or townhome, look at the total cost of your HOA and regime fees, because they may be two separate amounts.&nbsp;
