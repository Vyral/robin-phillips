Many people know a real estate agent, even if they don’t know them well. Sometimes, they’re your friends and family, and they seem like a convenient choice for home sellers looking for representation. However, is it really the best idea to hire an agent who’s a friend or family member? Let’s go through the pros and cons.

<u><strong>The Pros:</strong></u><br><br>**1\. There’s no interview process.**

**2\. You already know the person well**, meaning there’s little chance of a personality conflict.<br><br>**3\. They might cut their commission** as a favor to you.

<u><strong>The Cons:</strong></u><br><br>**1\. You need to share your current financial information with them**. You might not want all your friends or family knowing the details about your personal finances that an agent will need to understand in detail.<br><br>**2\. It might be uncomfortable to ask them about their track record.** A great agent is one who has a great track record selling homes quickly and has a solid marketing strategy. If the agent is your friend or family member, you might be less comfortable asking them to prove their expertise.<br><br>**3\. They may not have the money or knowledge to market your home.** The agent in your friend group/family may just be doing it part-time, meaning they’ll have less experience and knowledge than a full-time real estate agent.<br><br>**4\. You risk being put on the back burner.** If that agent does cut their commission for you, it’s worth asking if they’ll prioritize other clients that are paying them more. What’s more, if they’re getting less commission, does that also mean they’ll be spending less money on your marketing and less time on your listing? Will your listing end up sitting on the market longer simply because you’re getting a lower commission rate? It’s pretty hard to be angry at a friend or family member.<br><br>**5\. You may lose the ability to hold them accountable.** It’s hard to tell a friend or family member that they’re not doing a good job; you don’t want to hurt their feelings.<br><br>**6\. Can you fire your family or friends?** And if you do, what will happen to that relationship? I’ve had two instances in my career where I’ve taken over a listing for someone who did hire their friend or family member and they’re no longer speaking. Sometimes this kind of relationship is best left at a professional level.
