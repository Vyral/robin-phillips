*Here’s part one of my two-part forecast for the 2022 real estate market.*

Everyone has been asking me about the real estate market in 2022 and what’s going to happen, so today I’m here to offer my thoughts.

First and foremost, I want to talk about interest rates. We’re hearing that they will go up from many industry experts. **Most predict that we’ll hit the 4% range by the end of 2022.** This means that homes are going to get more expensive even if prices don’t rise or come down slightly. It’s better to buy while rates are lower. Waiting to buy until the end of 2022 could cost you.

Next, let’s discuss inflation’s effect on real estate. In general, inflation causes the cost of materials to go up, so we do see housing prices increase during inflationary times. We have extremely low inventory, and that won’t change in 2022.&nbsp;

**The good news is that the inventory situation has improved slightly.** A balanced market has around six months of inventory. That equates to about 10,000 homes for sale in Charleston. Back in May, we had just 1,200 homes on the market in our MLS. That includes all types of homes. That’s incredible\! Today we are sitting right around a few thousand properties. We’re still nowhere close to a neutral market, but the situation is improving for homebuyers.

We are also having trouble getting home-building materials. **If you’re building a home, this is going to increase your costs and delay your timeline.** That’s not going to loosen up, either.&nbsp;

As for housing prices, they’re going to continue to keep climbing, but they should level off as we get more inventory. This is very market and price-point specific, but I will say that we won’t see the 10% monthly price hikes that we saw this past summer.

If you’ve been thinking about using real estate to increase your wealth,&nbsp;**it’s a great time to purchase an investment property.** For one, it can offset your taxes. Rental rates are also going to continue to go up, which is good for your bottom line.

Stay tuned for part two of this extensive market forecast for 2022. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
