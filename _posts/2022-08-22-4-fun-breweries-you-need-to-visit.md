We are very lucky here in Charleston to have so many craft breweries. You may know the big names, but I’m here to introduce you to a few you may not be aware of. They all have great environments, fun food choices, and of course, awesome beer, so make sure to check out all these breweries\!&nbsp;

They are **Two Blokes, Westbrook Brewing Co., Hobcaw Brewing Co., and Ghost Monkey.** Have you been to all of these? If not, you better get started\!&nbsp;

Know that you can always count on me for great local information and everything you need to know about real estate. Call or email me anytime if you have questions or need suggestions. Maybe I’ll see you at one of these breweries soon\!
