For today’s message, I have a favor to ask.&nbsp;

This market is absolutely crazy right now. Roughly 54% of all listings are going under contract with offers that are over asking price. Of that 54%, 19% are having their appraisals come back under the offer price and contract price. What does this mean for buyers and sellers?

Buyers are often making as many as six offers on homes before one of them is accepted. These offers are usually over asking price and without an appraisal contingency. If you have no appraisal contingency, it means that if the home doesn’t appraise, you pay the contract price anyway and have to bring cash to the table to buy the house. People are also buying houses as is, which means there are no inspections involved. If there’s a major issue going on with a house and you don’t perform an inspection, you won’t find out about that issue until after the closing, and it will be your problem to fix—not the seller’s.&nbsp;

**It’s a tough process to navigate, and sellers are having huge problems as well.** If you’re a seller, where do you price your home? What the price was four months ago isn’t what the price would be today. Do you price it under market value to generate multiple offers? Should you price it close to market value since everyone’s going to offer over asking price anyway? What if they don’t go as high as you expect, though? If you get 10, 15, or even 20 offers, how do you pick the right one? Which criteria do you even look for? After you choose an offer, how do you get the contract to close while potentially dealing with all of the problems from the buyer’s end that we mentioned?&nbsp;

I have to say, I’m super nervous for every buyer and seller out there right now. It’s a stressful time not just for them, but for agents as well. We stake our reputations on doing an amazing job, and now we don’t even know what’s going on sometimes. We don’t know what the price of your home will be tomorrow.&nbsp;

So, this is how you can help me. It’s more important than ever to have an experienced, caring agent on your side. Someone who will fight for you, listen to you, and ensure you get the right home on the right terms within your budget. Now more than ever, testimonials are critically important. I**f you’ve worked with me in the past, I kindly request that you email me a two- to three-sentence summary of your experience.** You can also use this link to leave a testimonial on my Zillow profile. If you haven’t worked with me, I implore you to vet whichever agent you choose to work with; interview and talk to them about their experiences in the current and previous markets. Now is not the time to just roll with the punches.&nbsp;

Thank you so much for your business. I can’t wait to help you buy or sell a home in 2021. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me. Have a wonderful day\!
