Here are the top 10 least desirable home features among today’s buyers:

**1\. Laminate countertops.** Right now, granite is the gold standard, and more and more homeowners are installing quartz.&nbsp;

**2\. Oak-colored kitchen cabinets.** If you have these, refinishing them is much cheaper than replacing them. Here in Charleston, white kitchen cabinets are more desirable.&nbsp;

**3\. White kitchen appliances.** If you’re going to buy new kitchen appliances, go with stainless steel if you have light kitchen cabinets. If you have dark kitchen cabinets, go with black stainless steel. If you’re in a luxury home, have them paneled to match whatever color your kitchen cabinetry is.&nbsp;

**4\. A floor plan closed off to the main living area.** Nowadays, everyone is asking for an open floor plan, which means the kitchen and main living area are open to one another.&nbsp;

**5\. Carpet on the main level.** No homebuyer wants carpet on their home’s main level. Luxury vinyl plank (which is very durable) is becoming more and more popular, but buyers still prefer wood more than anything else.&nbsp;

**6\. Yellow, orange, red, or purple paint.** If any part of your home is painted in one of these colors, it should be repainted. If you have anything painted green, try repainting in a lighter shade.&nbsp;

**7\. Gold or brass hardware on the doors and fixtures.** While gold is making a comeback, it’s more of a brushed gold that’s becoming popular, which is a little less orange and a little bluer. If you love gold, go with lighter tones and/or the brushed gold. Otherwise, go with stainless steel or black.&nbsp;

**8\. Whirlpool tubs in the master bathroom.** These are hard to maintain, so most people prefer free-standing tubs instead.&nbsp;

**9\. Low bathroom vanities.** These were trendy in the 80s, but nowadays, vanities are much higher.&nbsp;

**10\. Mix-and-match flooring.** If you have hardwood flooring throughout your home, make sure it’s the same type of hardwood with the same stain. Nobody wants different types of hardwood in each bedroom.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about the updates you plan on making to your home—whether they’ll bring you top dollar, what your budgetary constraints will be, or what the trends are—don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
